## Show your work

1.  Create a Public repository ( please dont make a pull request, clone the private repository and create a new plublic one on your profile)
2.  Commit each step of your process so we can follow your thought process.

## What to build
The following is a list of items (prioritized from most important to least important) we wish to see:
* Design and implement a frontend for the game
* When a cell with no adjacent mines is revealed, all adjacent squares will be revealed (and repeat)
* Ability to 'flag' a cell with a question mark or red flag
* Detect when game is over
* Persistence
* Time tracking
* Ability to start a new game and preserve/resume the old ones
* Ability to select the game parameters: number of rows, columns, and mines
* Ability to support multiple users/accounts
 
## Deliverables we expect:
* Code in a public Github repo
* README file with the decisions taken and important notes

## Bonus Points
* URL where the game can be accessed and played (use any platform of your preference: heroku.com, aws.amazon.com, etc)

## Time Spent
We suggest not spending more than 2-3 hours total.  Please make commits as often as possible so we can see the time you spent and please do not make one commit.  We will evaluate the code and time spent.
 
What we want to see is how well you handle yourself given the time you spend on the problem, how you think, and how you prioritize when time is sufficient to solve everything.

Please email your solution as soon as you have completed the challenge or the time is up
